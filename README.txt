My pride and joy, in this repository I have stored all of my notes from
teaching myself SQL. I will also be storing my SQL solution to various quiz-
zes from around the internet. Let it be known that any solution/solutions
I store in this repository will not include prompt, tips or any questions
material from the site the question originates. My solutions are developed
by me and the notebook material I have no claim over since it is annotated
from sites like W3School.com as well as my own Bootcamp.

Cheers,
Dylan
